Ingredients

1 Lb. of Harina P.A.N (pre-cooked corn flour, other brands like Maseca or Masarepa can be used too)
1 Tablespoon of salt
2 Tablespoons of vegetable shortening
4 cups of warm water (warm from the tap about 135°F)

Procedure

    In a large bowl, mix by hand by combining water, salt and shortening together first, then slowly adding the flour, mixing quickly to avoid lumps.  Alternatively, in an electric mixer, combine all ingredients and mix on medium/low for 2 minutes until shortening is completely combined and the mixture is homogeneous.
    Keep dough covered with a moist towel and let dough rest for 10 minutes.
    Once rested, portion dough into a 6 oz. ball and flatten it as if making a burger patty or hockey puck. The AREPA needs to be thick enough that it can be sliced and stuffed like a pocket. An approximate size is about ½” thick and 4½ ” in diameter. The edges of the AREPA need to be sloped down instead of flat, straight edges.
    Set all AREPA on a sheet tray.
    To cook, first seal the AREPA on a flat griddle that has been previously oiled for 2 minutes on each side.
    To finish, place the AREPA on the hot grill for 5-8 minutes on each side. Alternatively, it can be cooked in the oven at 350°F for 10-15 minutes. The AREPA is ready when it sounds hollow if tapped in the middle. It needs to be crunchy on the outside.
    Using a small, serrated knife, slice through the middle halfway, making sure that the bottom part is not sliced open (fillings will fall out otherwise).
    Stuff generously with your favorite filling and serve immediately!
